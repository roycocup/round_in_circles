# Round in Circles

[For Mashup Game Jam - 6 June 2020](https://itch.io/jam/mashup-game-jam)

A combination of Super Pang and Asteroids

## Main mechanics

A ship in the center of the screen tries to shoot and pop the bubbles that are bouncing around the screen. 
The player can only move the ship around a ring, where the ship is fixated on, and can also shoot those bubbles. 
If any bubble touches the ship, the player dies. 
When a bubble is shot, it will split in two and reduce its size, until its small enough and it disappears. 
The smaller the bubbles are, the faster tehy move.
The game will have a time limit for each level. 
Levels will vary with the ship ring radius becoming bigger or smaller, and the number and speed of the bubbles.
